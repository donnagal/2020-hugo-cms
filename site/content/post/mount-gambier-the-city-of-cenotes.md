Uniquely set on the slopes of a dormant ‘maar’ volcano, **Mount Gambier’s** subterranean network of limestone channels lies just beneath the city streets. It’s here you’ll uncover remnants of a volcanic past where caves, crystal lakes, underground aquifers and cenotes (sinkholes) sit at its heart. Caverns and crevices testify to long-extinct megafauna, and a closer look at the rocks bears evidence of the inland sea complete with embedded fossils, shells and bones.



## A geological wonderland

Known for its crater lakes, including the aptly named Blue Lake, which turns a dazzling cobalt blue in the summer months, Mount Gambier is a worthwhile pilgrimage for nature lovers. History buffs will delight, too, at exploring a geological wonderland of cenotes left by natural forces, shedding light on the region’s fascinating past.
